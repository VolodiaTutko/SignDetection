## Introduction

Sign Detection is an essential aspect of computer vision applications, especially in the context of autonomous vehicles, road safety systems, and urban planning. This project aims to provide a robust and versatile solution for detecting signs in different environments.

## Features

- **Sign Detection**: The core functionality involves the detection of signs in images or video frames.
- **Classification**: The system classifies detected signs into predefined categories (e.g., stop signs, yield signs, etc.).
- **Customization**: Users can train the system on new sign categories to enhance its recognition capabilities.
- **Real-time Processing**: The system is optimized for real-time processing, making it suitable for applications requiring quick responses.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Sign Detection project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/VolodiaTutko/SignDetection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd SignDetection`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the main application: `python SignDetection.py`
2. Provide input images or video streams for sign detection.
3. View the results, including detected signs and their classifications.
